About This Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our documentation is designed to be a comprehensive resource for understanding, using, and contributing to the
Plutobot project. For that purpose Sphinx is used.
The documentation covers a wide range of topics, including project introduction, setup instructions, usage guidelines,
and advanced configurations.

GitLab Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our documentation is hosted on GitLab, a platform for collaborative software development.
We take advantage of GitLab Pages, a built-in feature, to automatically build and publish our documentation to a
specific domain.
This means that our documentation is always up-to-date with the latest changes in our project repository.
The documentation is built using "Rolling Releases".

The automatic build option is done via the **.gitlab-ci-yml** script.

This repository has been forked from: https://gitlab.com/pages/sphinx
